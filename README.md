# Synergy‑Media

A Python‑based toolkit & application for processing and managing media content. Designed for hackathons or rapid prototyping, Synergy‑Media provides modular utilities, a main entry point, and flexible dependency management.

## About

Synergy‑Media aims to simplify media workflows by combining useful tools for media downloading, conversion, editing, and analysis. It is built to be modular, so you can plug in or replace components as needed. Ideal for demos, prototypes, or a launchpad for more advanced projects.

## Repository Structure

```
Synergy‑Media/
├── utils/                # Utility modules: helpers for tasks like conversion, download, analysis
├── st.py                 # Main script / entry point for running the application / workflows
├── pyproject.toml        # Project metadata and dependency configuration
├── uv.lock               # Locked versions of dependencies
├── .python-version       # Required Python version
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

* `utils/` contains helper scripts and modules.
* `st.py` is presumably the script used to start or drive the application.
* `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` handle dependency definitions and pinning.
* `.python-version` ensures consistency on what version of Python to use.

---

## Prerequisites

* Python (version specified in `.python-version`)
* Pip (or a package manager compatible with `pyproject.toml`)
* (Optional) System tools / binaries depending on what `utils/` modules use — e.g. `ffmpeg`, etc., if media‐conversion or video/audio editing is involved.

---

## Setup & Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Kathir-03/Synergy-Media.git
cd Synergy-Media

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the dependencies
# If using pyproject.toml with e.g. poetry:
# poetry install

# Or if dependencies are listed via pip (you may generate a requirements.txt if needed)
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here are suggested ways to run or demo the project. Update these once you have finalized behavior or UI.

* **Run the main application / workflow:**

  ```bash
  python st.py
  ```

* **Use utility modules** (from `utils/`) to perform specific tasks. For example:

  ```bash
  python utils/some_utility.py --input path/to/media --output path/to/result
  ```

* If there is a web UI (Streamlit or similar), or a demo mode:

  ```bash
  streamlit run st.py
  ```

  *This assumes `st.py` supports being run as a Streamlit app.*

---

## Configuration

* `.python-version` specifies the version of Python the project expects.
* `pyproject.toml` holds dependencies, project metadata.
* `uv.lock` is the lock file for dependencies — ensures reproducible installs.
* If there are environment variables (e.g. API keys) or external service credentials (for downloading, AI model access, etc.), those should be documented here (e.g. `.env` file).

## Potential Features (Examples You May Want to Include / Highlight in Hackathon)

*(Fill in the ones you have, or plan to implement. These help showcase what your project can do.)*

* Download media content from URLs (YouTube, etc.)
* Convert formats (video ↔ audio, compress, trim, merge)
* Extract metadata from media files (duration, resolution, etc.)
* Integrate with speech‑to‑text or object recognition models
* Visualization / preview of results (via UI or saved outputs)
* Batch‑processing of files or scripts to automate workflows

## Contributing

Your collaboration is welcome! If someone wants to help improve Synergy‑Media:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your feature or bugfix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```
3. Make the changes, test them locally.
4. Commit with clear, descriptive messages.
5. Push branch to your fork, then open a Pull Request.

Please document code changes and avoid breaking existing workflows or utilities without notice.

If you like, I can prepare a polished **README.md** formatted for presentation (with images, slide instructions, demo script) for your hackathon. Do you want that?
